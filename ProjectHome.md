# What is the _MiningSuite_? #

_MiningSuite_ is a comprehensive Matlab framework for signal, audio and music analysis, articulating audio and symbolic approaches.

This framework is a continuation of the _[MIRtoolbox](MirToolbox.md)_ project, going further into the design of an innovative environment offering a large range of audio and music analysis tools that can be freely articulated via a highly adaptive syntactic layer on top of Matlab. The _MiningSuite_ is a substantial step forward for several reasons:
  * Audio and symbolic analyses are unified into a single framework.
  * Exhaustive pattern mining capabilities allow detailed motivic and metrical analyses.
  * The _MiningSuite_ features an innovative and integrative set of symbolic-based musicological tools.
  * The code and architecture has been entirely rebuilt, in order to foster computational efficiency, code readability, organisation and generality. The project has migrated to an open-source collaborative environment open to all contributors.
